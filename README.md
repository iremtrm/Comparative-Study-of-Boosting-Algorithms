# Breast Cancer Classification Using Boosting Algorithms

## ðŸ“Œ Description

Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer type among women worldwide. Early diagnosis and accurate classification are essential for effective treatment. In this project, the **Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer dataset** was used to classify tumors as **benign or malignant** using **boosting algorithms**.

## ðŸ“Š Algorithms Used

- AdaBoost
- Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)
- XGBoost
- LightGBM
- CatBoost

Each algorithm was applied to the dataset and evaluated based on accuracy and confusion matrix metrics.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries

- Python 3.x  
- pandas  
- scikit-learn  
- xgboost  
- lightgbm  
- catboost  
- matplotlib / seaborn

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

- Dataset: Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer  
- Samples: 569  
- Features: 30 (Mean, SE, and Worst for various tumor dimensions)  
- Labels: `Benign`, `Malignant`  
- Source: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic))

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iremtarim/breast-cancer-boosting.git
