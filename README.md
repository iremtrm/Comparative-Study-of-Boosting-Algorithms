Breast Cancer Classification Using Boosting Algorithms
Project Overview
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting women worldwide. Timely and accurate diagnosis plays a vital role in successful treatment. This project focuses on classifying breast tumors as benign or malignant using several boosting algorithms, leveraging the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer dataset.

Methods Applied
The study implements and compares the performance of multiple boosting techniques, including:

AdaBoost

Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)

XGBoost

LightGBM

CatBoost

Models were evaluated primarily through accuracy scores and confusion matrices to determine their effectiveness.

Technologies and Libraries
Python 3.x

pandas

scikit-learn

xgboost

lightgbm

catboost

matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization

Dataset Details
Source: Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer dataset

Number of samples: 569

Features: 30 numeric features describing tumor characteristics (mean, standard error, and worst measurements)

Labels: Benign or Malignant
